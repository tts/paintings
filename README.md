Widths of the paintings by Pekka Halonen at [Finna](https://finna.fi) [as a table](https://tuijasonkkila.fi/halonen.html). Why? To find out, whether his work titled [Rock Covered in Ice and Snow](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pekka_Halonen_-_Rock_Covered_in_Ice_and_Snow_-_A_II_1006_-_Finnish_National_Gallery.jpg) is exceptionally wide, which would explain the two canvases in one frame. Answer: it is not. But note: it is the one with the biggest width/height ratio (shown in the HTML below).

Along the same lines, the [height & width](https://tuijasonkkila.fi/maalaukset.html) of a selection of paintings by Halonen, Schjerfbeck and Danielson-Gambogi. These three because some friendly people have made a similar table from their works in Wikipedia.

To do: a Shiny app to select & show the dimensions of several artists from the same era. The FINNA API revisited in [finnaq.R](https://github.com/tts/paintings/blob/main/finnaq.R)
